## DESCRIPTION

I reproduced the famous console game known as "SPACE INVADERS‚Äù on CLI because
I was too lazy to learn a usage of GUI libraries.
This is my first like-project codes, so forgive me for the awfully messy codes.
I tried to depend on as few libraries as possible. Hence, there's no usage of fast operation libraries based on C such as Numpy.
But you might still need some adjustments such as installing python libraries
and settings of terminal like a background color and font size.
Hopefully, I will add some audio, organize the codes and transplant these into faster language one day.

Please enjoy and thank you for downloading!
